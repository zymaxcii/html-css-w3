	<h1>Vicissitudes of Life</h1><hr>
	<h2>Library, Bookmarks and Templates for re-use</h2>
	<p>As part of my learning culture, I like to read, learn, try and experiment with various things, including software and hardware. Sometimes I do feel overwhelmed by it and suffer from information overload. I don't need:-</p>

    <p>All these stuff because I live a simple, minimalistic life style. programming skills. Web server. Wiki, etc.</p>
	<ul>What I should try to achieve is just to build up a library of knowledges and resources that I can dip into, re-use it, when the need arises.</p>
    <li>A library of codes in PG usb stick</li>
    <li>A library of urls in Firefox bookmarks: Install, Repo, Tool</li>
    <li>A library of ebooks in Ultra64GB usb stick. </li>
