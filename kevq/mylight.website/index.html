		<h1>Welcome!</h1>

		<p>Welcome to <i>MyLight.Website</i>, my name is Kev Quirk and I wrote this entire website by hand to prove that
			you can still have a good looking, functional website that is quick and light too.</p>

		<p><b>This webpage is less than 100KB in size and it contains only a single line JavaScript!</b></p>

		<p>This site doesn't include any Google call outs either - all fonts are served direct from the web server. So
			if you're a privacy person, like me, there ain't no Google here! This site also scores straight 100s for
			performance, accessibility, best practices & SEO on <a target="blank"
				href="https://lighthouse-dot-webdotdevsite.appspot.com//lh/html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmylight.website%2F">Google's
				Lighthouse test</a>.</p>

		<p>Once I decided I was going to build this website, I thought it would be a good idea to write a series on <a
				target="blank" href="https://kevq.uk">my blog</a> about how to build a website just like this one, from
			scratch.</p>

		<p>If you want to start working through my <i>Making A Website</i> series, use the <a href="start.html">Start
				Here</a> link in the menu bar above. The series is integrated into this website and is designed to be a
			supplement to the posts on my blog (links available on the <a href="/downloads.html">downloads page</a>).
			You will start with an extremely simple website, and end with a site that looks just like this.</p>
