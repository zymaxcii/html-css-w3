        <h1>Getting started With Git – A Simple Beginner’s Guide</h1>
        <p>I’ve been using Git for around a year now and over the course of that year, it has become a crucial part of
            my workflow. But getting started with Git is difficult – there are lots of getting started guides out there,
            but I’ve found many of them to be too verbose for a beginner. </p>
        <p>So I decided to write a simple getting started with Git guide that covers just enough for you to get started
            and no more. Let’s get going, shall we?</p>
        <div class="small-p">
            <p>I’m not going to mess around with pre-waffle here, like what is Git? and all that jazz. Fact of the
                matter is, if you’re on this page I’m confident that you probably know what Git is already. </p>
            <p>The aim of this post is to give you enough to do the basics with Git and get going. From there you can
                continue to learn more if you need it.</p>
            <p>The rest of this post will assume you’re using GitHub for your remote repositories, but all of the Git
                commands are the same no matter which service you use.</p>
